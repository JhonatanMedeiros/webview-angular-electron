# WebView Angular Electron

## üñ• Introduction

WebView Angular Electron with Angular 9 and Electron 8 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for Desktop applications.

Currently, runs with:

Angular v9.1.4
Electron v8.2.5
Electron Builder v22.6.0
With this sample, you can :

Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
Run your app in a production environment
Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac
/!\ Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted.

/!\ Angular 9.x CLI needs Node 10.13 or later to works correctly.
